## Master channel

Installation bundles are not available for master. However, you can get the SDK
directly from our GitHub repo by 'git cloning' the master channel (as
specified by -b master), and then trigger a download of the SDK dependencies:

```terminal
git clone -b master https://github.com/flutter/flutter.git
./flutter/bin/flutter --version
```

For additional details on how our installation bundles are structured, see
[Installation bundles](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Flutter-Installation-Bundles).
